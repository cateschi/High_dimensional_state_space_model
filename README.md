# A dynamic factor model approach to incorporate Big Data in state space models for official statistics

This repository contains the R codes and dataset for the estimation of the high-dimensional state space model proposed in the paper "A dynamic factor model approach to incorporate Big Data in state space models for official statistics" by Caterina Schiavoni, Franz Palm, Stephan Smeekes and Jan van den Brakel. Each R script can be employed to estimate the different models discussed in the paper. Namely
+ The script _LFS_model_ contains the function that estimates the Labour Force Model by using the Labour Force series as unique observed series.
